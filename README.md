JS wrapper for the WiiM HTTP API.

### Features

- Full TS support
- Updated field names & data types to improve legibility

###Â Background

- Written for API version 1.2
- Original API documentation found [here](https://www.wiimhome.com/pdf/HTTP%20API%20for%20WiiM%20Products.pdf)
- Tested on WiiM AMP in the UK. The only device this is verified to work for.

### Progress

I am working on this in my spare time, between full-time work and a degree, unfortunately I don't have too much time to make progress.

Over time, more features will be added, but for the current time, I am just adding what I have time for, and want for other projects!

### Future wishes

- [] Add unit tests... this should be a thing already
- [] Add all API actions
- [] Add API explorer using Swagger or similar
- [] Publish to NPM

###Â Security note
WiiM products use self-signed certificates. In order to process requests, this needs to be accepted, which is a vulnerability. Use at your own risk!

### Contributing

If you fancy it, submit a PR to add new actions / improve existing implementations. I might even merge it in!
